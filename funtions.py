In this problem we'll be working with a simplified version of blackjack (aka twenty-one). In this version there is one player (who you'll control) and a dealer. Play proceeds as follows:

The player is dealt two face-up cards. The dealer is dealt one face-up card.
The player may ask to be dealt another card ('hit') as many times as they wish. If the sum of their cards exceeds 21, they lose the round immediately.
The dealer then deals additional cards to himself until either:
the sum of the dealer's cards exceeds 21, in which case the player wins the round
the sum of the dealer's cards is greater than or equal to 17. If the player's total is greater than the dealer's, the player wins. Otherwise, the dealer wins (even in case of a tie).
When calculating the sum of cards, Jack, Queen, and King count for 10. Aces can count as 1 or 11 (when referring to a player's "total" above, we mean the largest total that can be made without exceeding 21. So e.g. A+8 = 19, A+8+8 = 17)

For this problem, you'll write a function representing the player's decision-making strategy in this game. We've provided a very unintelligent implementation below:

This very conservative agent always sticks with the hand of two cards that they're dealt.

We'll be simulating games between your player agent and our own dealer agent by calling your function.

Try running the function below to see an example of a simulated game:

add Codeadd Markdown
q7.simulate_one_game()

The real test of your agent's mettle is their average win rate over many games. Try calling the function below to simulate 50000 games of blackjack (it may take a couple seconds):

add Codeadd Markdown
q7.simulate(n_games=50000)
add Codeadd Markdown
Our dumb agent that completely ignores the game state still manages to win shockingly often!

Try adding some more smarts to the should_hit function and see how it affects the results.
